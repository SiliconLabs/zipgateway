\page migration Migrating to Z/IP Gateway from Third-Party Gateways

\section migration_intro Introduction

With the release of Z/IP Gateway 7.x it is now a certification requirement to
use it for making Z-Wave gateways.

It is possible to perform a \em migration to the latest Z/IP gateway where
essential configuration data is transferred from the legacy gateway to the Z/IP
gateway such that when the Z/IP gateway is started, it will immediately be fully
functional with all the same included nodes.

The migration tools can also be used to restore a the ZGW node database from if 
the eeprom.dat file for sqlite database has been lost. This recovery scheme is 
only possible if a recovery JSON file can be generated from external data
sources. 

\note The current migration tools do not support importing IMA data and mailbox messages.

\section migration_process The Migration Process

\subsection migration_prerequisites Prerequisites

Migration is supported for gateways using Z-Wave static or bridge controllers
with firmware version 6.60 or later.

\subsection migration_process_overview Overview

In general, there are \b two migrations scenarios: <b>software migration</b> and
<b>hardware migration</b>. They are briefly outlined here but will be described
in detail in the following sections.

<b>Software Migration:</b>

Replace legacy gateway software with Z/IP Gateway software and updating the
firmware on a 500-series Z-Wave module with the latest Z-Wave bridge firmware.
The physical gateway device and the 500-series Z-Wave module are reused.

-# Construct a \c zgw.json file.
-# Install and configure Z/IP Gateway without starting it.
-# Stop legacy gateway.
-# Run migration import script.
-# Reboot gateway device to reconfigure network setting and start Z/IP Gateway.

It should be noted that the execution time of the migration tool is ~1 minute, due to
flashing of new firmware. USB devices are a bit faster than serial devices.

<b>Hardware Migration:</b>

A full migration where the legacy gateway device and/or the 500-series Z-Wave
module is replaced.

-# Construct a \c zgw.json file
-# On old device: stop legacy gateway.
-# On old device: install Z/IP gateway (to provide migration tools).
   Don't configure or start it.
-# On new device: install and configure Z/IP gateway without starting it.
-# On old device: extract NVM content from Z-Wave module.
-# Convert NVM content to format required by Z-Wave module on new device.
-# On new device: program Z-Wave module with latest Z-Wave bridge controller firmware.
-# On new device: write converted NVM content to Z-Wave module.
-# On new device: run gateway restore utility.
-# On new device: reboot gateway device to reconfigure network setting and start Z/IP gateway.

<b>Recovery:</b>
-# Construct a \c zgw.json file
-# On new device: run gateway restore utility.
-# Reboot gateway device to reconfigure network setting and start Z/IP Gateway.


\subsection migration_preparation Prepare the Migration

<ol>

<li> Download Z-Wave Embedded SDK from
https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/z-wave/embedded-sdk
and extract the serialapi bridge controller firmware image with the correct
Z-Wave chip and frequency.

<ul>
    <li> The embedded SDK for 500-series chips is version 6.81.xx and the firmware
      image to extract is serialapi_controller_bridge_\<chiptype\>_\<freq\>.hex

    <li> The embedded SDK for 700-series chips is version 7.xx and the firmware
      image to extract is ZW_SerialAPI_Controller_7.xx.xx_EFR32ZG14_REGION_\<freq\>.hex
</ul>

<li>Construct a \c zgw.json file containing data to be migrated from the
legacy gateway into the new Z/IP Gateway. See \ref zgw_json_schema for details
about this file.

<li>Check that the structure of \c zgw.json file is correct by validating it
against the zipgateway JSON-schema file. See \ref migration_json_validation.

<li>Download, install, and configure Z/IP gateway on the gateway device. Don't
start it or reboot the OS at this time. See \ref build and \ref install

\note If performing a <em>hardware migration</em>, Z/IP gateway must be
installed on \em both the \b old and the \b new gateway device. On the \b old
device only a few migration tools from the Z/IP gateway installation will be
used - the Z/IP gateway should never run on the old device and for that reason
it does not need to be configured there.

\note If any of the values for APP_MANUFACTURER_ID, APP_PRODUCT_TYPE_ID or APP_PRODUCT_ID  
has been changed in the SerialAPI controller target firmware, the values must be 
updated in nvm500_import.c. If the controller firmware is taken directly from a
SDK no action is needed. 
</ol>


When the above steps have been completed the actual migration can be performed.



\subsection migration_software Performing a Software Migration

For a <em>software migration</em>, where the gateway device and 500-series
Z-Wave module are updated to use Z/IP gateway and new Z-Wave bridge controller
firmware, do the following:

-# Ensure all steps mentioned in \ref migration_preparation have been performed.
-# Stop legacy gateway and modify system scripts to ensure it is not started
automatically again, ever.
-# Run the migration import script \c zgw_import.sh. See \ref
migration_run_import_script.
-# Reboot the device. This will ensure that changes to network settings
performed during Z/IP gateway installation are applied. During the reboot Z/IP
gateway will be started automatically. See \ref run.
-# The migration is complete!

\subsection migration_recovery Node database recovery

This recovery scheme is intended for the event where the node database 
eeprom.dat or zipgateway.db has been lost. A prerequisite for this recovery 
scheme is that the migration JSON file can be generated form external 
datasources.

For this recovery scheme a special "offline" is supported by the migration 
tool. See \ref migration_running_zgw_restore

The steps required in Node database recovery is:

-# Construct JSON file form external data source.
-# Upgrade ZGW debian package if needed
-# Run the zgw_restore tool 
-# Start the gateway

\subsection migration_hardware Performing a Hardware Migration

For a <em>hardware migration</em>, where the gateway device and Z-Wave module are
replaced, the \c zgw_import.sh script cannot currently be used. Instead do the
following:

<ol>

<li> Ensure all steps mentioned in \ref migration_preparation have been performed.

<li> On the \b old gateway device stop legacy gateway and modify system scripts to
ensure it is not started automatically again, ever.

<li> On the \b old gateway device run the \c zw_programmer utility to extract
the NVM (Non Volatile Memory) content from the old Z-Wave module and save it to
a (binary) file \c nvm_old.bin. Make a note of the NVM layout version (\em
nvm_version) reported by \c zw_programmer (\c "static6.6" in the following
example). See \ref migration_running_zw_programmer.

\verbatim
# zw_programmer -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -r nvm_old.bin
...
Serial version: ..., NVM: static6.6
...
\endverbatim

<li> On the \b old gateway device run the \c zw_nvm_converter utility to
convert/export the binary NVM file \c nvm_old.bin to a version independent \c
nvm.json file. Provide \c zw_nvm_converter with the NVM layout version (\em
nvm_version) noted in the previous step. See \ref
migration_running_zw_nvm_converter.

\verbatim
$ zw_nvm_converter -e static6.6  nvm_old.bin  nvm.json
\endverbatim

<li> Transfer the \c nvm.json file from the \b old gateway device to the \b new
gateway device.

<li> On the \b new gateway device run \c zw_programmer to program the Z-Wave
module with the firmware hex image previously downloaded as part of the Z-Wave
Embedded SDK. See \ref migration_running_zw_programmer.

\verbatim
# zw_programmer -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -p serialapi_controller_bridge_ZM5304_EU.hex
\endverbatim

<li> On the \b new gateway device run \c zw_nvm_converter to convert/import the
version independent \c nvm.json file to a binary \c nvm_new.bin file specific to
the firmware version of the Z-Wave module on the new gateway device. See \ref
migration_running_zw_nvm_converter.

\verbatim
$ zw_nvm_converter -i bridge6.8  nvm.json  nvm_new.bin
\endverbatim

<li> On the \b new gateway device run \c zw_programmer to write the converted
NVM content to the Z-Wave module. See \ref migration_running_zw_programmer.

\verbatim
# zw_programmer -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -w nvm_new.bin
\endverbatim

<li> Transfer the \c zgw.json file prepared previously (see \ref
migration_preparation) to the \b new gateway device.

<li> On the \b new gateway device run the ZGW Restore Tool to create
the zipgateway persistence data (zipgateway.db,
provisioning_list_store.dat, and NVM application area) from the
zgw.json file and the data in the bridge controller.  See \ref
migration_running_zgw_restore.

\verbatim
# zgw_restore -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -j zgw.json
\endverbatim

<li> Reboot the \b new Z/IP Gateway device. This will ensure that
changes to network settings performed during Z/IP Gateway installation
are applied. During the reboot the zipgateway process will be started
automatically, as a service.  See \ref run.

<li> The migration is complete!

</ol>



\section migration_tools Migration Support Tools

A number of tools are available to support a migration to Z/IP gateway.

\subsection migration_run_import_script Running the Import Script

The script \c zgw_import.sh (\c @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/bin/zgw_import.sh)
performs the steps needed to perform a <em>software migration</em> on same
hardware.

\verbatim
Usage: zgw_import.sh -s <serial dev> -f <target_firmware> -p <protocol_name> -j <json_file>
   -s <serial dev>      : device file to which the Z-Wave controller is attached,
                          defaults to the settings in zipgateway.cfg
   -f <target_firmware> : hex or gbl file of the bridge controller firmware to be
                          flashed on the module
   -p <protocol_name>   : name of the protocol which the firmware file implements
                          e.g. bridge6.8
   -j <json_file>       : ZGW Data JSON File that contains the data to import
   -o                   : offline mode no firmware update will be attempted
  
\endverbatim

For example:

\verbatim
# zgw_import.sh -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -p bridge6.8 -f serialapi_controller_bridge_ZM5304_EU.hex -j zgw.json
\endverbatim

\c target_firmware is the new Z-Wave bridge controller firmware image file.

\c protocol_name is the protocol name corresponding to the firmware image. It
can be one of the following:

- \c bridge6.8 : Z-Wave Bridge 6.8x
- \c bridge6.7 : Z-Wave Bridge 6.7x
- \c bridge6.6 : Z-Wave Bridge 6.6x

Normally a protocol name corresponding to the latest 500-series firmware image
should be used. Currently this is \c bridge6.8.

\note The script will compare the version of the firmware on the Z-Wave module
with the version specified with \c protocol_name, and \b only upgrade the NVM
and program the new firmware image \b if the versions are different. For this
reason, if the Z-Wave module e.g. contains 6.8x firmware (e.g. 6.81.01) and the \c
target_firmware file contains a 6.81.03 image mandating \c protocol_name to be
\c bridge6.8, then the Z-Wave module will \b not be re-programmed with that
newer image!



\subsection migration_running_zw_programmer Running zw_programmer

The \c zw_programmer utility (\c @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/bin/zw_programmer) can
be used to program a Z-Wave module as well as reading and writing its NVM
content.

\verbatim
Usage: zw_programmer -s serial_device [ -r nvm.bin | -w nvm.bin | -p firmware_image_file [-a] | -t ]

   -s specifies the path of for the Serial device / Z-Wave module.
   -r read the nvm contents from the serial_device into the specified filename in binary format.
   -w write the nvm contents to the serial_device from the specified filename in binary format.
   -p program a new firmware onto the serial_device from the specified filename.
      NB: for 500-series chips use a .hex file. For 700-series chips use a .gbl file.
   -a use if the chip is already in Auto Programming Mode (enforced by holding down the reset button).
      NB: This option is valid only for 500-series chips.
   -t test mode. Will connect to serial device and show info about the Z-Wave module.
\endverbatim



\subsection migration_running_zw_nvm_converter Running zw_nvm_converter

The \c zw_nvm_converter utility (\c @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/bin/zw_nvm_converter)
can be used to convert NVM (Non Volatile Memory) content exported from a
specific Z-Wave firmware version to NVM content to be imported into a different
Z-Wave firmware version.

\verbatim
Usage: zw_nvm_converter [-i <format_name> |-e <format_name> ] <src> <dst>
   -e Export mode, produce a JSON file from an NVM file.
   -i Import mode, produce a NVM file from a JSON file.

Note for bridge7.16 and onward NVM migration is handled by the Z-Wave
module automatically so the corresponding steps for zw_nvm_converter should be skipped.

supported formats are:

   bridge7.15 : NVM Converter for Z-Wave Bridge 7.15
   bridge7.12 : NVM Converter for Z-Wave Bridge 7.12
   bridge7.11 : NVM Converter for Z-Wave Bridge 7.11
   bridge6.8 : NVM Converter for Z-Wave Bridge 6.80
   bridge6.7 : NVM Converter for Z-Wave Bridge 6.70
   bridge6.6 : NVM Converter for Z-Wave Bridge 6.60
   static6.8 : NVM Converter for Z-Wave Static 6.80
   static6.7 : NVM Converter for Z-Wave Static 6.70
   static6.6 : NVM Converter for Z-Wave Static 6.60
\endverbatim

Note that as stated in the help message about supported formats, for bridge7.16 and onward NVM migration is handled by the Z-Wave module automatically so the corresponding steps for zw_nvm_converter should be skipped.
For example, to transfer the NVM content \b from a 500-series static controller
on /dev/ttyUSB0 running firmware 6.60 \b to a 500-series bridge controller on
/dev/ttyUSB1 running firmware 6.81.03:

\verbatim
# zw_programmer -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -r controller_66.bin
$ zw_nvm_converter -e static6.6 controller_66.bin controller.json
$ zw_nvm_converter -i bridge6.8 controller.json controller_68.bin
# zw_programmer -s /dev/ttyUSB1 -w controller_68.bin
\endverbatim

To transfer the NVM content \b from a 700-series bridge controller
on /dev/ttyUSB0 running firmware 7.16 \b to a 700-series bridge controller on
/dev/ttyUSB1 running same version firmware 7.16 :

\verbatim
# zw_programmer -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -r controller_7_16.bin
# zw_programmer -s /dev/ttyUSB1 -w controller_7_16.bin
\endverbatim

\note The NVM in a 500-series controller can hold 2 Kb of application data. On a
700-series controller there is only set aside 512 bytes for application data.
When converting the NVM between a 500-series controller and a 700-series
controller (calling \c zw_nvm_converter with \c -i \c bridge7.11) the \c
zw_nvm_converter will show the following warning message:

\note \verbatim
WARNING: "applicationData" will be truncated. Bytes with non-zero values: 2048. Max application data size in generated NVM image: 512.
\endverbatim

\note This means that the JSON file provided to \c zw_nvm_converter contains more than
512 bytes of (non-zero) application data. Since the application area in a
500-series controller NVM can be left uninitialized most of that data is
probably just random. A Z/IP gateway will never store more than 512 bytes of
application data.



\subsection migration_running_zgw_restore Running zgw_restore

The ZGW Restore Tool is used to restore the runtime state of the zipgateway
process from a Z/IP Gateway migration package created based on the configuration
of an older Z/IP Gateway (pre-7.11.01 release) or a third-party gateway.

\verbatim
Usage: zgw_restore -s serial_dev -j backup_file [-i installation_path] [-d data_path]
   -s: Device name of the serialport which has the Z-Wave controller module attached
   -j: Location of the json backup file to use for the restore
   -o: Offline mode, read all data json file without using the controller module
   -i: Installation prefix, path to the gateway configuration files (default /usr/local/etc/)
   -d: Location of the zipgateway storage files, zipgateway.db and provision_list.dat (default /usr/local/var/lib/zipgateway/)
\endverbatim

The restore tool has a special offline mode, where a
zipgateway.db file can be re-constructed without access to the Z-Wave
controller module. However the offline option require addition fields to be
added to the JSON file. The additional fields are:
 - zgw.nodeList[].isZGW
 - zgw.nodeList[].zgwZWNodeData.nodeType
 - zgw.nodeList[].zgwZWNodeData.mode

It should also be noted that the following fields in the JSON file are ignored
in offline mode:
 - zwNetworkData.zwSecurity.ECDHPrivateKey
 - zwNetworkData.zwSecurity.S0key
 - zwNetworkData.zwSecurity.S2AuthenticatedKey
 - zwNetworkData.zwSecurity.S2UnauthenticatedKey
 - zwNetworkData.zwSecurity.S2AccessKey
 - zwNetworkData.zwSecurity.S2UnauthenticatedKeyLR
 - zwNetworkData.zwSecurity.S2AccessKeyLR


\see \ref zgw-restore.

\subsection migration_json_validation Validating Gateway JSON Import Files

The ZGW Restore Tool assumes that the bridge controller has already
been restored (see \ref migration_running_zw_nvm_converter).  It then
uses the restored Z-Wave bridge controller and a ZGW Data File to
regenerate the runtime state of the zipgateway process.  This data
file must be constructed from data extracted from the original
controller (see \ref zgw_json_schema).

Customers with third-party gateways should develop tools to automatically
generate the ZGW Data File. To aid in the construction of the file
a JSON schema file (see https://json-schema.org) is available in the Z/IP
Gateway bundle at this location: \c systools/doc/zgw_json.schema.json

The generated JSON files should be checked for compliance with \c
zgw_json.schema.json. This is done using a <em>JSON schema validator</em>.

One such validator is https://github.com/Julian/jsonschema which is a set of
Python scripts that can be installed with \c pip as:

\verbatim
$ pip install jsonschema
\endverbatim

To validate a JSON file run \c jsonschema validator this way:

\verbatim
$ jsonschema -i my_zgw.json systools/doc/zgw_json.schema.json
\endverbatim

If the ZGW Data File is not compliant with the schema, then \c jsonschema will
indicate what the error is. In some cases the error messages will unfortunately
be quite difficult to use for troubleshooting.

In general \c zgw_restore should not be executed using JSON files that have not
been validated against \c zgw_json.schema.json.



\section zgw_json_schema ZGW Data File

When migrating to a Z/IP Gateway from a different type of controller,
the state of the zipgateway process must be re-created by the restore
tool.  To allow this, the properties of the controller and the Z-Wave
network must be written to a zipgateway JSON file (the ZGW Data File).  (Note
that this is not the same JSON format as the one used by the NVM
converter.)

Several example zipgateway JSON files can be found in the \c
systools/doc/ folder:

- \c zgw_example_NoProbe.json : as much information as possible provided for
  migration, so that the Z/IP Gateway does not need to probe the network.
- \c zgw_example_FullProbe.json : as little information as possible provided
  for migration so that Z/IP Gateway has to probe the network to function
  normally. Note that the endpoint list for each node MUST have the correct
  number of endpoints for the node, including the root device (endpoint 0). The
  information for each endpoint can be minimal, see, e.g., node 4 in this example.
- \c zgw_example_MinimalNoProbe.json : the minimal information provided for Z/IP
  Gateway not to probe and work reasonably well after migration.

The JSON schema for the ZGW Data File format is available at \c
systools/doc/zgw_json.schema.json.

According to the JSON schema some fields are optional. It should be
noted that if some of the optional fields are left out for a node, the
gateway may re-interview the node when starting up.

If the zipgateway has to re-interview a node, this will be done
immediately when the zipgateway process starts up, except for sleeping
nodes.  Sleeping nodes will be interviewed when the zipgateway
receives the first Wake Up Notification from that node.

\note If the zipgateway receives many Wake Up Notifications within a
short interval, or while it is still interviewing listening nodes, the
interview of the sleeping node may fail, because the sleeping node
only waits 10s for a reply.

\note If the migration data provided in the ZGW Data File is not
correct, the Z/IP Gateway may not behave correctly after migration.

This section documents the JSON schema defining the ZGW Data File.

\see For details on how these fields correspond to the data structures
in the zipgateway process, see \ref sec_persist_org.

\section zw_controller_json_schema Z-Wave Controller NVM Data file

When migrating to a Z/IP Gateway or performing a backup/restore of a Z/IP
Gateway or replacing a Z-Wave controller, the content of the Z-Wave controller
NVM storage must be migrated too. During this process the NVM content is
extracted with \c zw_programmer (see \ref migration_running_zw_programmer) and
converted to a JSON file with \c zw_nvm_converter (see \ref
migration_running_zw_nvm_converter). The content of the controller NVM JSON file
should normally not be modified by hand.

The JSON schema of the controller NVM JSON file is available in the file \c
systools/doc/zw_controller.schema.json.

This section documents the JSON schema defining the structure of the Z-Wave
controller NVM JSON file.
